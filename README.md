## Meno-together 

Overview

Menopause is a natural phase of life for women that typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55. 

There is very little general knowledge available about it and unfortunately, it is often surrounded by misconceptions, stigma and lack of understanding, leading to women sometimes feeling embarrassed, isolated and unsupported during this transition. 

Partners, colleagues and friends may not know how to recognize the symptoms of menopause or how to provide effective support, resulting in potentially strained relationships and decreased quality of life for women experiencing menopause.

## Product Vision

Meno-together aims to bridge the current gap in understanding and support for women going through menopause by providing comprehensive information and resources for partners & other surrounding groups, such as colleagues and friends. 
The platform will serve as a one-stop destination for education, empathy and practical tips to help loved ones navigate this significant life transition together.
