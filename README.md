## Meno-Together 

**Overview**

Menopause affects anyone who menstruates, and refers to the phase of life when periods stop due to lower hormone levels. It usually happens between the ages of 45 and 55, but it can happen earlier. Perimenopause happens in the lead up to menopause - where periods haven't yet stopped (for at least 12 months), but there are symptoms of menopause. These symptoms can be difficult and confusing to deal with when they happen - e.g. anxiety, mood swings, hot flushes, brain fog and forgetfulness, dry skin.. to name but a few - and they can have a big impact on general life, relationships and work.

There is very little general knowledge available about it and unfortunately, it is often surrounded by misconceptions, stigma and lack of understanding, leading to those experiencing menopausal symptoms sometimes feeling embarrassed, isolated and unsupported during this transition. 

Partners, colleagues and friends may not know how to recognize the symptoms of menopause or how to provide effective support, resulting in potentially strained relationships and decreased quality of life for anyone experiencing menopause.

**Meno-Together** aims to provide information on different symptoms that may affect people during menopause (as well as perimenopause), in a friendly, upbeat and inclusive way that helps to engage all ages and backgrounds. It contains symptom information pages that can help not only those experiencing menopause, but their partners, friends, family, and work colleagues.

We have considered the use of our language, design and advice across the pages to be as neutral and inclusive as possible, highlighting that menopause affects not just those who identify as women, and also to appeal more broadly across different age groups. However, it must be stressed that this hackathon project was developed in a very short space of time, so there is more that we aim to do in future to make this a truly inclusive space with extra features of support.

As a team, we have recognised there is a lack of support and education for everyone involved when it comes to menopause, so the best approach for us to encourage positive change is to **"MAKE MENOPAUSE EASIER, TOGETHER".**
